I am a PhD student at Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University. 

My supervisors are Kim Guldstrand Larsen and Chistian Schilling. I focus my research on shielded AI, where a shield compontent filters the actions of an AI-agent, such that the system as a whole is guaranteed to be safe, even when the AI-agent alone is not.
